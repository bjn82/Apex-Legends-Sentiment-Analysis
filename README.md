# Apex-Legends-Sentiment-Analysis

How does Twitter feel about Apex Legends?

A look at twitter scraping and rudimentary sentiment analysis on the (as of mid-march) latest big battle royale game.

by Brennan James Donnell

## Intro:
There is a new kind of game on the scene. *Battle Royale*. This genre of games is like *The Hunger Games*: a bunch of people fall out of the sky onto an island and find weapons and items to survive and take out other players while constantly moving towards a central location. While this concept isn't a new idea, in 2017 the genre finally became tangible and even profitable to major developers in 2018. 

## What is *Apex Legends* and why should I care?
As stated before, *Apex Legends* is a battle royale game, and the latest one to boot. Since it was released, it took livestreaming platforms by storm. It was also the first battle royale game to be released by a developer under a major publisher, Electronic Arts (or EA). It wasn't released as an additional game mode, but as a stand-alone game. It is unique among the other battle royale games in that it mixes-in concepts from the hero-shooter genre, such as player-classes and roles. Additionally, it is a squad-based game where players are put into up to 20 teams of 3 players each. Why people should care is that by the end of the first week of its launch, it had over 25 million players, and then 50 million within the first month of release. It is also a *free-to-play* game, supported entirely by microtransactions for cosmetics and in-game currency. The game's development was kept a secret until it was released on February 4th, 2019. The surprise release and sudden success eclipsed the recent 13% drop in EA's stock.

## Known issues:
* **This is not perfect**: It is a work-in-progress.
* Currently it only uses one day of data and it isn't from today.
* Pretty bare-bones at this point.
* Slow.

---

## Future steps:
* Add a *Further information* tab as a quick-reference.
* I have a lot of data and I would like to have a way to filter through the data, as well as have a way to scrape through the data.
* Going forward, I'd like to track twitter sentiment as updates roll out and the community grows.
* Idea implementation list:
    + People who come up
    + Sentiment during outages
    + "celebrity" endorsements (famous people, athletes, internet personalities, etc)
    + How does it compare with its competition, such as *PUBG* and *Fortnite*.
